My first website I've ever made, I took inspiration from Alan Bay Walker's Wolf Project but I wanted to give it a bit of my own spin on it.
I tried to only code it with what I knew at the time from my Head First HMTL/CSS book I just recently finished reading. I did have to look up a bit of stuff here and there when I got stuck.
I had a lot of trouble with the CSS placement of paragraphs and images. I also threw in a product order page at the end for fun! I also attempted to make it compatible up to 1440p and also down to mobile to the best of my abilities at the time.

I made this in 2 days of work and it helped to cement the basics of what I've been learning somewhat.
